# Project: Learning How to Learn
## About the Project
**Learning How to Learn** is a static website that is intended to discuss the most effective, cutting-edge learning techniques that one can apply to their daily life. The website highlights the main problem with education and lines out some techniques to improve the learning process.  

- Five Learning Strategies from Barbara Oakley:
  1. Two Ways of Thinking
  2. Recall
  3. Interleaving
  4. Questions
  5. Illusion of Competence

- Few TED talks:
  1. [The first 20 hours -- how to learn anything | Josh Kaufman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY)
  2. [Inside the mind of a master procrastinator | Tim Urban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU)

- Barbara Oakley’s story of learning
- The Feynman Technique of Learning
- Few facts and figures on learning and the brain
- Salman Khan and his passion and views on learning
- Ten principles of rapid skill acquisition by by Josh Kaufman

The website provides some extra useful resources on learning techniques and hacks:
  - [TEDEd](https://ed.ted.com/search?qs=learning+techniques+and+hacks)
  - [Medium](https://medium.com/the-innovation/top-learning-hacks-to-learn-more-efficiently-effectively-e076989986bb)
  - [dezeen](https://www.dezeen.com/)
  - [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49537956-studying-techniques)

## Technologies and Standards Used
The technologies that have been used are:
  1. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
  2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

The main concepts that have been emphasized are:  
  1. [Semantic HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html)
  2. [HTML Iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe)
  3. [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)
  4. [Document Flow and Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position)
  5. Animation and Transform with CSS

The website is using [BEM — Block Element Modifier](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) methodology to create reusable and understandable components in CSS. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting. We are also using [Nested BEM File structure organization](https://en.bem.info/methodology/filestructure/#nested) for CSS.

## Future Improvements
There are few improvements that I am looking to work upon:
1. Including a form in the webpage that allows users to submit a comment.
2. Making the website responsive.
3. Implementing a navigation to access the different sections of the webpage.
